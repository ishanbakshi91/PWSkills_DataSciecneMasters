In other words, data abstraction refers to the ability to present only the essential information to the user, while hiding the underlying implementation details.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and functions into a single unit (i.e., an object). In Python, you can achieve data abstraction by using classes and objects. By keeping the implementation details within the class and only exposing the necessary methods and properties, you can achieve data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Abstract Base Classes: In Python, you can use the abc (Abstract Base Class) module to define abstract base classes. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. By defining an abstract base class, you can specify the methods and properties that must be implemented by any class that inherits from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Modules: In Python, you can use modules to achieve data abstraction. A module is a way to group related functions and data into a single unit. By hiding the implementation details within a module and only exposing the necessary functions and data, you can achieve data abstraction.\n",
