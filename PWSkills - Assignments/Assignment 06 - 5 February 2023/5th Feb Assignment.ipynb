    "\n",
    "     1 Encapsulation -  wrapping of data (properties) and functions (methods) into a single unit or object. It ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through a well-defined interface.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     2 Inheritance - the ability of a new class to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class. The new class is called a subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called a superclass or base class.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     3 Abstraction - the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary information to the users.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     4 Polymorphism - the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class, enabling code reusability and making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n",
